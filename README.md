# temperature_forecast_email
This program is designed to send an email to a specified recipient containing the weather forecast for the current location.

You need to add some information for the program to work :

MY_EMAIL =              #Add your email address (make a new one if needed)
MY_PASSWORD =           #Add your password. You can make one for general use, at least on gmail.
CLIENT =                #Add email address of recipient

Also you can change these variables for other cities. The default is for Thessaloniki, Greece

MY_LATITUDE = 40.629269 #Change long and lat for different cities.
MY_LONGITUDE = 22.947412
